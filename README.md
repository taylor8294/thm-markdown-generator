# TryHackMe Room Markdown Generator

_Python script for automatically generating a markdown question-and-answers file for TryHackMe rooms._

[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) is a free online platform for learning cyber security, using hands-on exercises and labs, all through your browser.

When completing the 'rooms' that TryHackMe offers, many users want to take note of their answers and how they solved the room as they go. This can lead to a lot of copying and pasting of the questions from the room webpage into your write-up.

I came across [this blog post](https://burakb.net/tryhackme-tasks-and-questions-to-markdown-snippet/) which presents a way to automatically generate a starting template write-up file (in markdown syntax) by pasting a little javascript into the browser console on the room's webpage. I felt it was a useful little tool when working with TryHackMe, so turned it into a python script for easier use from the command line. 

## Install

### Download

I use [`pdm`](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) to manage my python projects.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/taylor8294/THM-Room-Markdown.git
cd THM-Room-Markdown
pdm sync
pdm run python src/THM-Room-Markdown.py -h
```

To do so just using regular old `pip` (without PEP 582 support)

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/taylor8294/THM-Room-Markdown.git
cd THM-Room-Markdown
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/THM-Room-Markdown.py -h
```

## Example Usage

You just need to run the script, passing it a room code and an output file.

```
$ pdm run python src\THM-Room-Markdown.py -h
usage: THM-Room-Markdown.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-d] [-v] room
